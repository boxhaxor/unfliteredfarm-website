We are Unfiltered Farm - we produce natural, minimally processed farm products. Our core values are transparency, authenticity and honesty with our farming operation.

We're millennials with years of experience surfing a desk in the corporate world, this is us becoming more in tune with the earth.  Our philosophy for farming includes a focus on sustainability, using environmentally-friendly practices, and incorporating technology and innovation into farming methods. Additionally, our philosophy for farming includes an emphasis on community engagement, education and transparency in the food production process, and access to fresh and healthy food for all. Many millennial farmers also have interest in small-scale, diversified and resilient farms, in contrast to traditional industrial agribusiness.

We believe in sharing and the open source community.  The source code for this website is on GitHub:
